It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable, and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development. There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system, which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world. However, university professors still utilized some autonomy, at least in the sciences, to choose epistemological foundations and methods. For instance, Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction. Another example was the short-lived but fairly rapid adoption of Cartesian epistemology and methodology in European universities,", "original_crit": -2.018406867980957, "sampled": "Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number of the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should have been the same place where the great philosophers did. (That the great philosophers were at that time philosophers does not take into account a position that these scholars were not students of the great philosophers as they had been of the great mathematicians.)\n\nThis is a very difficult argument that does not have the kind of empirical support it needs to be discussed in order to be relevant to the question we have before us. However, it is hard to deny that there was some effort made by the philosophers to make it seem that there was a gap between knowledge of the philosophers and the content of the philosophical material which could be considered as such. Many philosophers have been careful to distinguish between the claims and the evidence of their material.

The public secular is the largest school group, and is attended by the majority of Jewish and non-Arab pupils in Israel. Most Arabs send their children to schools where Arabic is the language of instruction. Education is compulsory in Israel for children between the ages of three and eighteen.
